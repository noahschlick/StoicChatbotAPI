Interviewer: How should stoics live thier life?
Interviewee: Occupy thyself with few things, says the philosopher, if thou wouldst be tranquil.—But consider if it would not be better to say, Do what is necessary, and whatever the reason of the animal which is naturally social requires, and as it requires. For this brings not only the tranquillity which comes from doing well, but also that which comes from doing few things. For the greatest part of what we say and do being unnecessary, if a man takes this away, he will have more leisure and less uneasiness. Accordingly on every occasion a man should ask himself, Is this one of the unnecessary things? Now a man should take away not only unnecessary acts, but also unnecessary thoughts, for thus superfluous acts will not follow after.

Interviewer: What are the daily actions for stoic philosophers?

Interviewer: How should we approach decisions on life? 
Interviewee: A good person is invincible, for they don’t rush into contests in which they aren’t the strongest. If you want their property, take it—take also their staff, profession, and body. But you will never compel what they set out for, nor trap them in what they would avoid. For the only contest the good person enters is that of their own reasoned choice. How can such a person not be invincible?

Interviewer: How should I control my ambitions?  
Interviewee: A good person is invincible, for they don’t rush into contests in which they aren’t the strongest. If you want their property, take it—take also their staff, profession, and body.

How can such a person not be invincible?

Interviewer: How should I deal with failure?  
Interviewee: The first difference between a common person and a philosopher is this: the common person says, Woe to me for my little child, for my brother, for my father.1 The philosopher, if he shall ever be compelled to say, Woe to me, stops and says, 'but for myself.' For nothing which is independent of the will can hinder or damage the will, and the will can only hinder or damage itself. If then we ourselves incline in this direction, so as, when we are unlucky, to blame ourselves and to remember that nothing else is the cause of perturbation or loss of tranquillity except our own opinion, I swear to you by all the gods that we have made progress. But in the present state of affairs we have gone another way from the beginning. For example, while we were still children, the nurse, if we ever stumbled through want of care, did not chide us, but would beat the stone. But what did the stone do? Ought the stone to have moved on account of your child's folly? Again, if we find nothing to eat on coming out of the bath, the paedagogue never checks our appetite, but he flogs the cook. Man, did we make you the paedagogue of the cook and not of the child?2 Correct the child, improve him. In this way even when we are grown up we are like children. For he who is unmusical is a child in music; he who is without letters is a child in learning: he who is untaught, is a child in life.

Interviewer: How should I react when somthing bad happens in life?

Interviewer: What if I have a disadventage in life?
Interviewee: As the nature of the universal has given to every rational being all the other powers that it has, so we have received from it this power also. For as the universal nature converts and fixes in its predestined place everything which stands in its way and opposes it, and makes such things a part of itself, so also the rational animal is able to make every hindrance its own material, and to use it for such purpose as it may have designed.

Interviewer: What should be my mind set when having a disadvantage?

Interviewer: Why is virtue important?
Interviewee: This can be swiftly taught in very few words: virtue is the only good; there is no certain good without virtue; and virtue resides in our nobler part, which is the rational one. And what can this virtue be? True and steadfast judgment. For from this will arise every mental impulse, and by it every appearance that spurs our impulses will be rendered clear.

Interviewer: What are some good impulses I should have?
Interviewee: This can be swiftly taught in very few words: virtue is the only good; there is no certain good without virtue; and virtue resides in our nobler part, which is the rational one.

Interviewer: Why should I practive philosophy?
Interviewee: Philosophy is no trick to catch the public; it is not devised for show. It is a matter, not of words, but of facts. It is not pursued in order that the day may yield some amusement before it is spent, or that our leisure may be relieved of a tedium that irks us. It molds and constructs the soul; it orders our life, guides our conduct, shows us what we should do and what we should leave undone; it sits at the helm and directs our course as we waver amid uncertainties. Without it, no one can live fearlessly or in peace of mind. Countless things that happen every hour call for advice; and such advice is to be sought in philosophy.

Interviewer: What happens if there is nothing but trouble in my life?
Interviewee: You have endured infinite troubles through not being contented with your ruling faculty, when it does the things that it is constituted by nature to do. But enough of this.

Interviewer: How should I conduct my self?
Interviewee: Many words have been spoken by Plato, Zeno, Chrysippus, Posidonius, and by a whole host of equally excellent Stoics. I'll tell you how people can prove their words to be their own — by putting into practice what they've been preaching.

Interviewer: No time for theorie, just results.
Interviewee: When the problem arose for us whether habit or theory was better for getting virtue—if by theory is meant what teaches us correct conduct, and by habit we mean being accustomed to act according to this theory—Musonius thought habit to be more effective.

Interviewer: Stoic view on perfection.
Interviewee: We don't abandon our pursuits because we despair of ever perfecting them.

Interviewer: How to deal with someone who dislikes you.
Interviewee: Don’t tell yourself anything more than what the initial impressions report. It’s been reported to you that someone is speaking badly about you. This is the report-the report wasn’t that you’ve been harmed. I see that my son is sick but not that his life is at risk. So always stay within your first impressions, and don’t add to them in your head this way nothing can happen to you.

Interviewer: Start with where the world is.
Interviewee: Do now what nature demands of you. Get right to it if that’s in your power. Don’t look around to see if people will know about it. Don’t await the perfection of Plato’s Republic, but be satisfied with even the smallest step forward and regard the outcome as a small thing.

Interviewer: How do I manage my work flow?
Interviewee: Do now what nature demands of you. Get right to it if that’s in your power. Don’t look around to see if people will know about it. Don’t await the perfection of Plato’s Republic, but be satisfied with even the smallest step forward and regard the outcome as a small thing.

Interviewer: What to do if I feel overwhelmed with life?
Interviewee: Do now what nature demands of you. Get right to it if that’s in your power. Don’t look around to see if people will know about it. Don’t await the perfection of Plato’s Republic, but be satisfied with even the smallest step forward and regard the outcome as a small thing.

Interviewer: Stoic Philosophy on the place that you live.
Interviewee: Such as are thy habitual thoughts, such also will be the character of thy mind; for the soul is dyed by the thoughts. Dye it then with a continuous series of such thoughts as these: for instance, that where a man can live, there he can also live well. But he must live in a palace;—well then, he can also live well in a palace. And again, consider that for whatever purpose each thing has been constituted, for this it has been constituted, and towards this it is carried; and its end is in that towards which it is carried; and where the end is, there also is the advantage and the good of each thing. Now the good for the reasonable animal is society; for that we are made for society has been shown above. Is it not plain that the inferior exist for the sake of the superior? but the things which have life are superior to those which have not life, and of those which have life the superior are those which have reason.

Interviewer: What should you do if it seems as though you are going through hard times?
Interviewee: Apply yourself to thinking through difficulties—hard times can be softened, tight squeezes widened, and heavy loads made lighter for those who can apply the right pressure.

Interviewer: Stoics on when life gets overwhelming.
Interviewee: Apply yourself to thinking through difficulties—hard times can be softened, tight squeezes widened, and heavy loads made lighter for those who can apply the right pressure.

Interviewer: What if it seems like you are about to loose?
Interviewee: Apply yourself to thinking through difficulties—hard times can be softened, tight squeezes widened, and heavy loads made lighter for those who can apply the right pressure.

Interviewer: Stoic philosophers view on silence.
Interviewee: Silence is a lesson learned from the many sufferings of life.

Interviewer: Stoic philosophers view on silence.
Interviewee: Be silent for the most part, or, if you speak, say only what is necessary and in a few words. Talk, but rarely, if occasion calls you, but do not talk of ordinary things – of gladiators or horses races or athletes or of meats or drinks – these are topics that arise everywhere – but above all do not talk about men in blame or compliment or comparison. If you can, turn the conversation of your company by your talk to some fitting subject; but if you should chance to be isolated among strangers, be silent.

Interviewer: Being jealous of some body.
Interviewee: You must stop blaming God, and not blame any person. You must completely control your desire and shift your avoidance to what lies within your reasoned choice. You must no longer feel anger, resentment, envy, or regret.

Interviewer: Blaming other for your failures.
Interviewee: You must stop blaming God, and not blame any person. You must completely control your desire and shift your avoidance to what lies within your reasoned choice. You must no longer feel anger, resentment, envy, or regret.

Interviewer: How to live a good life.
Interviewee: At this moment you aren’t on a journey, but wandering about, being driven from place to place, even though what you seek—to live well—is found in all places. Is there any place more full of confusion than the Forum? Yet even there you can live at peace, if needed.

Interviewer: Living a good life.

Interviewer: Musonius Rufus on exile.
Interviewee: Indeed, how could exile be an obstacle to a person’s own cultivation, or to attaining virtue when no one has ever been cut off from learning or practicing what is needed by exile?.

Interviewer: Why is it not logical to expect perfection.
Interviewee: A cucumber is bitter—Throw it away. There are briars in the road—Turn aside from them.—This is enough. Do not add, And why were such things made in the world? For thou wilt be ridiculed by a man who is acquainted with nature, as thou wouldst be ridiculed by a carpenter and shoemaker if thou didst find fault because thou seest in their workshop shavings and cuttings from the things which they make. And yet they have places into which they can throw these shavings and cuttings; but the universal nature has no external space; now the wondrous part of her art is that though she has circumscribed herself, everything within her which appears to decay and to grow old and to be useless she changes into herself, and again makes other new things from these very same, so that she requires neither substance from without nor wants a place into which she may cast that which decays. She is content then with her own space, and her own matter and her own art.

Interviewer: Why we all have our place in nature as humans?
Interviewee: If the philosophy of Stoicism is asking me to live according to Nature, it is asking me to always be completely human in the ways that I think and act. This does not need to be a vague and mysterious concept, or the pursuit of some impossible task. It is simply asking me to be who I was made to be, to live in harmony with my very identity as a creature designed to know and to love. This responsibility always comes first, and all other wants or circumstances must be ordered toward it. An emerald should keep its color. A man should keep his virtue. Anything less is an abandonment of who and what I am. Yes, other people will change their tune, or pull away from their promises, or speak in one way and then act in another. Yes, others may sadly make their excuses, but I do not need to do so. Whatever someone else has said and done, I do not need to define myself by what he has said and done. I do not need to respond in kind to the way I have been treated, and I do not need to become what I must of necessity confront. I can be good, I can be an emerald, and I can keep my color.

Interviewer: Why is it important to live life as nature intended?
Interviewee: If the philosophy of Stoicism is asking me to live according to Nature, it is asking me to always be completely human in the ways that I think and act.

Interviewer: How should I deal with my responsibilities?
Interviewee: Let it make no difference to you whether you are cold or warm, if you are doing your duty. And whether you are drowsy or satisfied with sleep. And whether ill-spoken of or praised. And whether dying or doing something else. For it is one of the acts of life, this act by which we die. It is sufficient then in this act also to do well what we have in hand.

Interviewer: How should I act if an inconvenience occurs in my life?
Interviewee: The task of a philosopher: we should bring our will into harmony with whatever happens, so that nothing happens against our will and nothing that we wish for fails to happen.

Interviewer: How can I practice resilience?
Interviewee: The task of a philosopher: we should bring our will into harmony with whatever happens, so that nothing happens against our will and nothing that we wish for fails to happen.

Interviewer: How can flip my frame on situations?
Interviewee: The task of a philosopher: we should bring our will into harmony with whatever happens, so that nothing happens against our will and nothing that we wish for fails to happen.

Interviewer: Is doing good easy?
Interviewee: Good people will do what they find honorable to do, even if it requires hard work; they’ll do it even if it causes them injury; they’ll do it even if it will bring danger. Again, they won’t do what they find base, even if it brings wealth, pleasure, or power. Nothing will deter them from what is honorable, and nothing will lure them into what is base.

Interviewer: Is it easy to be a good person?

Interviewer: What are the challenges of being a good person?
Interviewee: On those mornings you struggle with getting up, keep this thought in mind—I am awakening to the work of a human being. Why then am I annoyed that I am going to do what I’m made for, the very things for which I was put into this world? Or was I made for this, to snuggle under the covers and keep warm? It’s so pleasurable. Were you then made for pleasure? In short, to be coddled or to exert yourself?

Interviewer: Why should I not rest more even though it is more plesent?
Interviewee: Do you exist then to take your pleasure, and not at all for action or exertion? Do you not see the little plants, the little birds, the ants, the spiders, and the bees working together to put in order their several parts of the Universe? And are you unwilling to do the work of a human being, and you do not make haste to do that which is according to your nature?

Interviewer: Shouldn’t it be necessary to rest more when needed?
Interviewee: It is necessary, however nature has fixed bounds to this too. She has fixed bounds both to eating and drinking, and yet you go beyond these bounds, beyond what is sufficient. Yet in your acts it is not so, but you stop short of what you can do. So you do not love yourself, for if you did, you would love your nature and her will. Those who love their several arts exhaust themselves in working at them unwashed and without food, but you value your own nature less than the turner values the turning art, or the dancer the dancing art, or the lover of money values his money, or the vainglorious man his little glory. And such men, when they have a violent affection for a thing, choose neither to eat nor to sleep, but rather than to perfect the things that they care for. But are the acts that concern society more vile in your eyes and less worthy of your labor?

Interviewer: What should be my attitude when life gets though?
Interviewee: Enough of this miserable, whining life. Stop monkeying around! Why are you troubled? What’s new here? What’s so confounding? The one responsible? Take a good look. Or just the matter itself? Then look at that. There’s nothing else to look at. And as far as the gods go, by now you could try being more straightforward and kind. It’s the same, whether you’ve examined these things for a hundred years, or only three.

Interviewer: I have dealt with a-lot of set backs in life recently how should I act?

Interviewer: Relationship between a king and the philosopher. 
Interviewee: I believe a good king is from the outset and by necessity a philosopher, and the philosopher is from the outset a kingly person.

Interviewer: How should I act as a man?
Interviewee: Labor not unwillingly, nor without regard to the common interest, nor without due consideration, nor with distraction; nor let studied ornament set off your thoughts, and be not either a man of many words, or busy about too many things. And further, let the deity which is in you be the guardian of a living being, manly and of ripe age, and engaged in matter political, and a Roman, and a ruler, who has taken his post like a man waiting for the signal which summons him from life, and ready to go, having need neither of oath nor of any man's testimony. Be cheerful also, and seek neither external help nor the tranquility that others give. A man then must stand upright, not be kept upright by others.

Interviewer: How can I improve my self?
Interviewee: Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves. Your visions will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakens.These are the characteristics of the rational soul: self-awareness, self-examination, and self-determination. It reaps its own harvest.. . .

Interviewer: What makes a good leader?
Interviewee: One man, when he has done a service to another, is ready to set it down to his account as a favour conferred. Another is not ready to do this, but still in his own mind he thinks of the man as his debtor, and he knows what he has done. A third in a manner does not even know what he has done, but he is like a vine which has produced grapes, and seeks for nothing more after it has once produced its proper fruit. As a horse when he has run, a dog when he has tracked the game, a bee when it has made the honey, so a man when he has done a good act, does not call out for others to come and see, but he goes on to another act, as a vine goes on to produce again the grapes in season—Must a man then be one of these, who in a manner act thus without observing it?—Yes—But this very thing is necessary, the observation of what a man is doing: for, it may be said, it is characteristic of the social animal to perceive that he is working in a social manner, and indeed to wish that his social partner also should perceive it—It is true what thou sayest, but thou dost not rightly understand what is now said: and for this reason thou wilt become one of those of whom I spoke before, for even they are misled by a certain show of reason. But if thou wilt choose to understand the meaning of what is said, do not fear that for this reason thou wilt omit any social act.

Interviewer: Why is it dangerous to have little knowledge?
Interviewee: Every great power is dangerous for the beginner. You must there fore wield them as you are able, but in harmony with nature.

Interviewer: Why should I do the right thing?
Interviewee: When you’ve done well and another has benefited by it, why like a fool do you look for a third thing on top—credit for the good deed or a favor in return?

Interviewer: How should I look upon my self spiritually?
Interviewee: About what am I now employing my own soul? On every occasion, I must ask myself this question, and inquire, what I now have in this part of me that they call the ruling principle? And whose soul do I have now? That of a child, or of a young man, or of a feeble woman, or of a tyrant, or of a domestic animal, or of a wild beast?

Interviewer: How do I deal with toxic people?
Interviewee: As those who try to stand in your way when you are proceeding according to right reason will not be able to turn you aside from your proper action, so neither let them drive you from your benevolent feelings toward them, but be on your guard equally in both matters, not only in the matter of steady judgment and action, but also in the matter of gentleness to those who try to hinder or otherwise trouble you. For this also is a weakness, to be vexed at them, as well as to be diverted from your course of action and to give way through fear; for both are equally deserters from their post—the man who does it through fear, and the man who is alienated from him who is by nature a kinsman and a friend.

Interviewer: What if sombody gets in the way of your goals?

Interviewer: How do you deal with people with different ideas?
Interviewee: My reasoned choice is as indifferent to the reasoned choice of my neighbor, as to his breath and body. However much we’ve been made for cooperation, the ruling reason in each of us is master of its own affairs. If this weren’t the case, the evil in someone else could become my harm, and God didn’t mean for someone else to control my misfortune.

Interviewer: What if I have to deal with ingnorant people?
Interviewee: Every soul, the philosopher says, is involuntarily deprived of truth; consequently in the same way it is deprived of justice and temperance and benevolence and everything of the kind. It is most necessary to bear this constantly in mind, for thus thou wilt be more gentle towards all.

Interviewer: How do I reason with incompetent people?

Interviewer: Why is it bad to be unjust?
Interviewee: He who acts unjustly acts impiously.

Interviewer: What should I do if I feel lazy?
Interviewee: When you rise from sleep with reluctance, remember that it is according to your constitution and according to human nature to perform social acts, but sleeping is common also to irrational animals.

Interviewer: How should I act when bad news is distributed to me?
Interviewer: Whenever disturbing news is delivered to you, bear in mind that no news can ever be relevant to your reasoned choice. Can anyone break news to you that your assumptions or desires are wrong? No way! But they can tell you someone died—even so, what is that to you?

Interviewer: What if I am envious?
Interviewer: When you see someone often flashing their rank or position , or someone whose name is often bandied about in public , don’t be envious; suck things are bought at the expense of life. . . . Some die on the first rungs of the ladder of success, others before they can reach the top, and the few that make it to the top of their ambition through a thousand indignities realize at the end it’s only for an inscription on their gravestone.

Interviewer: Why is financial success not that inportant?
Interviewer: When you see someone often flashing their rank or position , or someone whose name is often bandied about in public , don’t be envious; suck things are bought at the expense of life. . . .

Interviewer: Why should I focus more?
Interviewer: Often injustice lies in what you aren’t doing, not only in what you are doing.

Interviewer: What matters more than money and prosperity?
Interviewer: Indeed, if you find anything in human life better than justice, truth, self-control, courage — in short, anything better than the sufficiency of your own mind, which keeps you acting according to the demands of true reason and accepting what fate gives you outside of your own power of choice — I tell you, if you can see anything better than this, turn to it heart and soul and take full advantage of this greater good you’ve found.

Interviewer: What do I do if I get into an altercation with somebody?
Interviewee: Some people are sharp and others dull; some are raised in a better environment, others in worse, the latter, having inferior habits and nurture, will require more by way of proof and careful instruction to master these teachings and to be formed by them — in the same way that bodies in a bad state must be given a great deal of care when perfect health is sought.

Interviewer: Why should I practice philosophy?
Interviewee: The person who has practiced philosophy as a cure for the self becomes great of soul, filled with confidence, invincible—and greater as you draw near.

Interviewer: What is the best way to be joyful?
Interviewee: Trust me, real joy is a serious thing. Do you think someone can, in the charming expression, blithely dismiss death with an easy disposition? Or swing open the door to poverty, keep pleasures in check, or meditate on the endurance of suffering? The one who is comfortable with turning these thoughts over is truly full of joy, but hardly cheerful. It’s exactly such a joy that I would wish for you to possess, for it will never run dry once you’ve laid claim to its source.

Interviewer: What is stoic joy?

Interviewer: How much time should I spend on my career?
